# ER-death-counter
Death counter for Elden Ring. Uses Tesseract to take screenshots of your screen to detect the text "You Died". This way it doesn't interact with the game at all and can be used while still playing online.
This also means its a little bit inconsistent occasionally.

TODO:
- Get possible config setups for different souls games
- Better image normalization to more consistently capture deaths
